# Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a class (called a subclass or child class) derives from another class (called a superclass or parent class), inheriting its attributes and methods. This creates an “is-a” relationship: the subclass “is a” type of the superclass.
# Key Points
* Code Reuse:
* Extensibility:
* Method Overriding:
# When to Use Inheritance
* Use inheritance when there's a clear hierarchical relationship where one class is a subtype of another.
* For example, a Dog is an Animal, so it makes sense for Dog to inherit from Animal.
# Composition
Composition involves building complex objects by combining simpler objects. Instead of creating an "is-a" relationship, it creates a "has-a" relationship. For instance, a Car object "has an" Engine rather than being an engine.
# Key Points
* Encapsulation
* Flexibility
* Reusability
# An Overview of Inheritance in Python
# The Object Super Class
In Python, the object superclass is the top-level class from which all other classes inherit, either directly or indirectly. It provides a foundation for Python's class hierarchy and establishes common functionality that all objects in Python share.
# Exceptions Are an Exception
Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs. Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing.
# Creating Class Hierarchies
Creating class hierarchies in Python involves defining classes in such a way that they establish parent-child relationships, where child classes inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.
# Abstract Base Classes in Python
Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python are used to define a blueprint for other classes. An abstract base class  serves as a foundation for subclasses that must implement specific methods defined in the abstract class. 
# Implementation Inheritance vs Interface Inheritance
# Implementation Inheritance
Focuses on reusing existing functionality in a parent class.
# Interface Inheritance
Use Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) to define methods that subclasses must implement.
# The Class Explosion Problem
The Class Explosion Problem in Python happens when you end up creating too many classes to handle various combinations of features or requirements. This makes the code complex, hard to understand, and maintain. For example, if you need a new class for every slight variation of a shape or object (like color, size, or special properties), you end up with lots of classes, making the overall design difficult to manage.
# Inheriting Multiple Classes
In Python, multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.
# Composition in Python
# Flexible Designs With Composition
Composition is a design principle in Python that enables you to create flexible, modular, and reusable systems by combining objects instead of relying heavily on inheritance.
# customizing behaviour with composition in python 
ustomizing behavior with composition in Python involves creating flexible and reusable systems where you can easily alter or extend the functionality of objects by composing them with other objects or classes.
